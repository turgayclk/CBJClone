## 🛠️ Technical Info  

- Developed using **Unity 6**.  
- Although the project uses **3D models**, the camera perspective and lighting setup make the game appear **2D**, ensuring both visual clarity and performance.  
- The game scene is built on a **grid-based system**. The grid manages each vegetable's position and possible movements, preventing overlaps and making it easy to guide vegetables to the correct boards.  
- **GPU Instancing** is implemented, allowing many objects using the same material to be processed in a single draw call, reducing batches by up to 25% and improving performance.
